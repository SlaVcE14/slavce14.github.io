    <h1>Privacy Policy for Json List</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 24.10.2025</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        Json List does not automatically collect, store, or share any personal data from users.
        The app may access basic device information (such as screen size, model, and manufacturer) only for display and debugging purposes.
        This information is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted automatically.
        Users may choose to manually share logs or data via email for support or feedback. This action is completely voluntary.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Libraries</h2>
    <p>
        Json List uses the following libraries:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OkHttp</strong> – used only for optional, user-initiated network requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Gson</strong> – used locally for JSON parsing.</li>
        </ul>
        These libraries do not collect or share any personal data on their own.
        <br><br>
        Json List also uses various open-source UI libraries to provide dialog and interface components. These libraries operate entirely on-device and do not collect, store, or transmit any user data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The app does not share user data with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Json List is intended for users aged 16 and over and does not target children under 16.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If there are any updates to this privacy policy, they will be reflected on this page.</p>
